It also logs the total time for all logged tasks at the end.**\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install grunt-timer\n\n```\nnpm install grunt-timer ## --save-dev\n```\n\n### Upgrade your Gruntfile.js\n\nAdd the grunt-timer reference to the very top of your Gruntfile.js:\n\n```\nvar timer = require(\"grunt-timer\");\n```\n\nAdd the timer init call at the top of the module.exports function:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n    timer.init(grunt);\n```\n## Example output\n\n```\nRunning \"run:500\" (run) task\n500ms task ran\nTask 'run:500' took 502ms\nAll tasks took 502ms\n```\n\n## Options\n\nTo use any option, pass an object parameter to your initialise function like so:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n    timer.init(grunt, {deferLogs: true, friendlyTime: true, color: \"blue\"});\n\n```\n\n### deferLogs\n\nIf you'd prefer to see a summary of all your task timings at the end of the grunt process, enable this option.\n\nThis is useful for the case where you have many grunt tasks, or they generate a lot of output while they are running, \nand it might be tedious to scroll back through the console to find all the timing messages.\n\n### friendlyTime\n\nEnable this if you'd prefer to see the durations reported in a friendly hours/minutes/seconds format, instead of ms.\n\n```\nTask 'jshint:all' took 3 seconds \n```\n\n### totalOnly\n\nEnable this if you'd prefer to only see the time all tasks took to complete.\n\nThis is useful for having many small, insignificant tasks that would generate considerable output even with deferLogs.\n\n```\nAll tasks took 502ms\n```\n\n### color\n\nIf supplied, will override default purple for console output.\n\n## Notes\n\n- The last task duration is output after the \"Done, without errors\". This is due to the way the hooking for the task name change works.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://ilee.mit-license.org)\n",
